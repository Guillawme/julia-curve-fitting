# Datasets

The datasets in this directory come from the following publication:

Gaullier G, Roberts G, Muthurajan UM, Bowerman S, Rudolph J, Mahadevan J, Jha A,
Rae PS & Luger K (2020) Bridging of nucleosome-proximal DNA double-strand breaks
by PARP2 enhances its interaction with HPF1. *PLOS ONE* **15**: e0240932
<https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0240932>

The CSV files have been reformatted to be easy to read into a `DataFrame`.
Original files can be downloaded at <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3519435>

Here is the correspondance between each dataset and the article's figure (read
the article for details):

- `dataset_001`: figure 5A
- `dataset_002`: figure S1D
- `dataset_003`: figure S1C
- `dataset_004`: figure S1D
- `dataset_005`: figure S1C
- `dataset_006`: figure S1I
- `dataset_007`: figure S1I
- `dataset_008`: figure S1J
- `dataset_009`: figure S1J
- `dataset_010`: figure 5B
- `dataset_011`: figure 5B
- `dataset_012`: figure S5A
- `dataset_013`: figure S5A
- all datasets in `salt-titrations/`: figures S1G and S1H

The Pluto notebook in this repository will not give exactly the same values for
the model's best fit parameters and their errors as reported in the article
(table 1), probably because of different weighting approaches (all numerical
results in the article come from GraphPad Prism version 8).
